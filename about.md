Some information about me!

### More Information

Currently working as a Cloud Engineer for an AWS Managed Services Provider in Brisbane, Australia.

I started professionally in on premises managed services/consulting for creatives & mining (wierd combo, I know!).  Worked for myself for quite a while supporting customers on premises until we had our Son.

I gave it up to be fulltime Dad for 5ish years, getting really into CNC machines (currently own 3d printers, lasers and embroidery machines) & then decided I could try moving back into the workforce.

After having no success applying for about 6 months, I joined the AWS Re/Start program through Goanna Education, and landed my current job afterwards.

Now I don't super have much time for my crafting hobbies, but I've been spending my time learning more on the cloud to skill up and utilise it in the home.
