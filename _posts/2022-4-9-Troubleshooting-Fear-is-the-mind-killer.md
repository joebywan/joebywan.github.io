title: Fear is the mind killer!
---

This is an little thing I've written previously, but I wanted to put it up here.  I'm not immune to it, but I feel that talking about it more helps people be more conscious and acknowledge it while not being controlled by it.

Being that I've just recently gotten back into IT, my wife's changing careers, and I've been trying to help other grads from the Re/Start program or any other newbies to the industry I feel it's pertinent.

It roots you in place, where you don't want to be, regardless of if you already know that taking a step will be better for you.

I get people ask me how to do things, and when I explain it or show them, they get a bit ashamed/self conscious because it's pretty self explanatory when you think about it logically or getting anxious & emotional or going down a what if hole.

When I grew up we were broke.  So it was learn to do or fix, or go without.  Once you realise where you are now isn't what you want at all, anything you try can only improve your situation, or atleast you're back to where you started.

If it's broken, you either fix it, or it stays broke.  So have a go!

If you're comfortable with it, share how you've given into or overcome fear.  Or even looking back can you see where you've fallen prey to it previously?
