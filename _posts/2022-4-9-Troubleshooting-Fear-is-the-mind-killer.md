Fear really is the mind killer.

I get people ask me how to do things, and when I explain it or show them, they get a bit ashamed/self conscious because it's pretty self explanatory when you think about it logically or getting anxious & emotional or going down a what if hole.

When I grew up we were broke.  So it was learn to do or fix, or go without.  Once you realise where you are now isn't what you want at all, anything you try can only improve your situation, or atleast you're back to where you started.

If it's broken, you either fix it, or it stays broke.  So have a go!
