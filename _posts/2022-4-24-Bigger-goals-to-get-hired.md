title: Bigger goals to get hired
---

This is going to be a bit of an intro to the next couple of posts.  We've covered [keeping your ass in gear](https://knowhowit.com.au/maintain-momentum/).  We've also discussed [easy wins to getting hired](https://knowhowit.com.au/Three-easy-wins-for-getting-hired/).  Now we're going to talk about bigger goals you can set yourself that will take more time, but definitely be worth it.

In no particular order:
## Study

While cross industry skills are great, you're going to need to add some industry specific knowledge into that grey matter to increase your chances of getting hired.  There's a ton of people at entry level you're competing with, so add certifications and knowledge so you can apply at positions above that, reducing the pool, and increasing your chances.

* Certifications - They give you knowledge, and a badge you can display on your LinkedIn profile.  Certifications are great at getting you on a recruiter's radar to get interviews.

* Free Training - If you can't afford certifications, there are plenty of free courses online to use for probably any topic you can think of.  They just don't come with the certificate at the end.  It's a way you can get more on your resume without forking over $$ if money is tight.

* Projects - Show off your study with projects.  As I said, Certifications are great at getting interviews, projects are great at getting jobs.  Once you get the interview with your certification, projects give you something to show off, talk about, demonstrate your successes, failures, thought processes, troubleshooting etc.  If you've taken my advice from the easy wins article, you're also demonstrating that you know how to use git & GitHub.

* Soft/people skills - As a newcomer to the industry, you need to realise any interview is going to have a technical and cultural/personality component.  Soft skills are something you've been doing your whole life, so if you can make sure you ace that part of an interview, you've maximised your non-technical chances.  This can cover things like communication, critical thinking, leadership, teamwork, work ethic and plenty more.  You can practice these with strangers, friends, family.

* Create content - Remember how I said on LinkedIn you need to be active, this is an easy way to do that, that will add value & have people looking at your profile.  When you're learning something, other than projects, another way to demonstrate your knowledge is to teach.

Next week I'll go further into depth on these.  Do you have other suggestions?

All of what he's said is building momentum.  If each day you don't give up, you're atleast working towards your goals.

Start small.  

We'll use me as the example.

I've advised people to create content about their chosen field, so their experience is more visible, shows evidence of their communication skills & how they've setup a site.  Now I've had my boss and plenty of others tell me I should write about my experiences.  So now it's either I'm a do what I say, not what I do... or I get off my ass and create some mother!@#$ing articles!

So my goal I've set for myself is to release 1 per week on LinkedIn.  If I build up a buffer of surplus articles incase I have a down week, that's cool, but if I've been slack, I still have to post 1 per week.

I could have tried something ambitious like 1 per day, but again, we're starting small.  Baby steps, at this point it's about setting goals you can achieve so you get:

A: Experience in setting, fulfilling and achieving goals.
B: The confidence that comes with ticking something off your list.

So when you set yourself a goal, tell others about it.  It goes from being a goal that exists solely in your head to being out there.  It's a thing now.  It makes you feel more accountable and gives more pressure to stick with it.  I've told you about it.  I'm definitely accountable now :D

Continuing with myself as the example.  I set myself the goal to get a website setup within a week.  You could consider that as a sub-goal to 1 article/week on LinkedIn, either way, it's something to achieve.

This is getting a bit long, but basically start out with the small easy stuff, use that to build momentum and work up to the harder goals, or the tasks that take longer.  It means you're in the habit of working on your goals & can see that you'll get something out of it as you work on it.

Also the big mammoth tasks, break them down into subtasks.  A pie's eaten one bite at a time, same with the big goals.  Split them up and work on it piece by piece.

Next I'll be writing about some of the easy tasks you can do to work at getting into cloud.

I'd love to hear about how you've succeeded or failed at goal setting, and what you learnt from it.
