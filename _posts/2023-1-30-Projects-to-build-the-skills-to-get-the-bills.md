In my previous post [Bigger goals to get hired](https://knowhowit.com.au/Bigger-goals-to-get-hired/) I discussed different things to work towards in your quest for getting a job.

Here I'll be expanding on completing projects, and making some suggestions on what to do.

# Why should I do projects?  They don't make me any money!

Well that's definitely the short term view.  If you're doing projects, you'll be demonstrating multiple things to prospective employers.

## Learning/Demonstrating skills

When you're building something, you're gaining new knowledge, or atleast proving that you can use skills you already have.  It's a way to have more evidence in your corner that you're competent at things

## Project Management

Any project, no matter how small requires:
- dividing it up into smaller goals, noting dependencies, requirements, roadblocks etc
- researching things you haven't encountered before
- Troubleshooting problems
- Documenting your process

## Build a portfolio

As I've discussed previously, Github is your portfolio that will retain and display your work.

This will mean you have free access to version control, and it's a great method of displaying documentation.

Then when you're applying for roles, you can supply your Github profile to show employers what you've been up to.  It also provides talking points to use during the interview to control the flow of the conversation.

## Generate content to build a personal brand for more visibility to potential employers
Once you've got this evidence of the amazing skills you've learnt, you can then get double benefit from it by using it to make posts/articles online, giving yourself more visibility, better known to employers and recruiters alike.

## Projects to give a shot

First one I'd suggest is Cloud Resume Challenge.  It demonstrates cloud skills, gives you a project, and another avenue for advertising your resume.

The Cloud Developer Workbook, a resource created by Ryan Lewis, for free as a pdf online.  I think it's a great resource to start small, and move up to more difficult things.  Get it free here: https://workbook.ryanlewis.dev/
