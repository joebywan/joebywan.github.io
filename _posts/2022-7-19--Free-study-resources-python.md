title: Free Study Resources - Python
---

Continuing on from my last post about free learning resources to get you into cloud.  This time we're talking about Python.  I don't really think this is a super necessary one, because finding python resources to learn with is like getting drunk in a brewery.  Don't have to look far.  I'm not going to go over the top with a big list, here's the 3 I've played with the most.

* [https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) Freecodecamp's courses are all (you guessed it) free, but in my opinion are packed full enough they could easily charge.  This python course has a ton of explanation about each topic they're trying to deliver, along with quizzes, and you can follow along with the code to give stuff a try, or play around with it as you go.  At the end there's a handful of projects you can complete, and they'll give you a certificate afterwards.
* [https://automatetheboringstuff.com/](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) This full fledged book has been online and free for over 5 years, geared to give a beginner an introduction into automation which most cloud peeps use python for.  It might be a bit different learning from an ebook, but it's good for an intro into it.
* [https://realpython.com/](https://realpython.com/) Real python I find are good for an interesting read on a part of python I'd not had experience in, or if I feel like playing with something new, I can fire up one of their articles and get enough knowledge to have a poke around with something.  I know it's not super descriptive, but give them a read and you'll see what I mean.

Yeah it's a short one, but there's a ton of knowledge there and if you can get through the first two, you're well on your way.
