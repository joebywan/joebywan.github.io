title: Build and keep momentum
---

I know I was going to talk about getting into cloud, and trust me I am!

Now you could probably also call this habit building, but I think of momentum as the collective result of habits over time adding up to move you in a direction.

From the #1 idiot sandwich constructor himself:

All of what he's said is building momentum.  If each day you don't give up, you're atleast working towards your goals.

Start small.  

We'll use me as the example.

I've advised people to create content about their chosen field, so their experience is more visible, shows evidence of their communication skills & how they've setup a site.  Now I've had my boss and plenty of others tell me I should write about my experiences.  So now it's either I'm a do what I say, not what I do... or I get off my ass and create some mother!@#$ing articles!

So my goal I've set for myself is to release 1 per week on LinkedIn.  If I build up a buffer of surplus articles incase I have a down week, that's cool, but if I've been slack, I still have to post 1 per week.

I could have tried something ambitious like 1 per day, but again, we're starting small.  Baby steps, at this point it's about setting goals you can achieve so you get:

A: Experience in setting, fulfilling and achieving goals.
B: The confidence that comes with ticking something off your list.

So when you set yourself a goal, tell others about it.  It goes from being a goal that exists solely in your head to being out there.  It's a thing now.  It makes you feel more accountable and gives more pressure to stick with it.

Continuing with myself as the example.  I set myself the goal to get a website setup within a week.  You could consider that as a sub-goal to 1 article/week on LinkedIn, either way, it's something to achieve.

This is getting a bit long, but basically start out with the small easy stuff, use that to build momentum and work up to the harder goals, or the tasks that take longer.  It means you're in the habit of working on your goals & can see that you'll get something out of it as you work on it.

Also the big mammoth tasks, break them down into subtasks.  A pie's eaten one bite at a time, same with the big goals.  Split them up and work on it piece by piece.

Next I'll be writing about some of the easy tasks you can do to work at getting into cloud.

I'd love to hear about how you've succeeded or failed at goal setting, and what you learnt from it.
