So continuing on from how I tackle problems, another way is just to stop doing it.
I find this helps in two ways.

First, when you've been beating your head against a wall for hours trying to overcome what seems more and more to be an insurmountable problem, frustration, despair and anger set in (at least for me!).  Taking some time away lets you cool down, and come back with a calmer mindset that usually is more methodical and less likely to miss something.

Also taking the time away will usually help you reset assumptions that you've added incase they're the issue.

Secondly it gives your brain time to work on the problem in the background. In my case usually mid sentence having to stop what I'm doing and jot down or go and try out the idea before I lose it. It means I look like a crazy person, but my subconscious slowly working away at it in the background has saved my ass on many occasions.

So I've done 3 of these now. I'd love some feedback. Anyone finding these useful? Anyone done this in the past? Do you have different methods of problem solving? I'd love to hear it
