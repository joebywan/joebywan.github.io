title: "Troubleshooting: Ask an idiot"
---
When I'm working on a problem, I quite frequently get stuck and have to employ a variety of methods to overcome whatever obstacle I'm against.
One method I use is "ask an idiot".

This involves finding someone to discuss your issue with who ideally has no knowledge of the topic (not necessary, but helps).

When you're explaining something to someone who doesn't know anything it means you have to think like them so you can try and explain it in a manner that they can understand. This means that you're forced to mentally step through everything you've done and tried, and explain it as simple as possible or explain the principles behind what you're trying to do.

It quite often helps you figure out an incorrect assumption you've made or a flaw in your logic because it's the mental equivalent of showing your working out in school maths.

I figure instead of boring everyone with a gigantic wall of text, I'll try to do one of these once a week.

So what are your methods for solving a problem you're stuck on?
