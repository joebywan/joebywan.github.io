title: Free Study Resources
---

So you want to study, expand your horizons, but the wallet's a little light?  Never fear, because there's some really awesome free study material out there.

## AWS Study
AWS are constantly broadcasting that they do free training.  There's a bunch of free stuff online for it by AWS aswell as other providers.

* First of all, AWS has a free tier that they offer for 12 months.  Gets you access to a bunch of services in a limited fashion for a year.  Super useful for giving you a sandbox to play around in that if you're careful won't cost you anything.  Be sure to setup budget alerts & know what is/isn't in the free tier.  
* [aws.amazon.com/learning](https://aws.amazon.com/learning).  They even made a game to get you learning for the cloud basics.  Lookup cloud quest.
* [aws.amazon.com/architecture/back-to-basics/](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/back-to-basics/) Want to know about a specific topic?  AWS Solutions Architects talk about them, and you can watch for free.
* Other places to look for training material I like are freecodecamp (they have a youtube channel in addition to the site) with whole courses tailored for AWS certifications, aswell as Go Cloud Architects (youtube).  Go Cloud in particular talks quite often about how to get into cloud.
* [workshops.aws](https://workshops.aws) Great resource to learn by doing.  Watch a video, play in your free tier AWS account, learn something.  Just be aware of what resources are and aren't in your free tier.
* [wellarchitectedlabs.com](https://wellarchitectedlabs.com) Step by step labs that walk you through your AWS account to implement solutions.
* [github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs](https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs) Step by step labs created by Adrian Cantrill.

Considering how long this has been, I think I'm going to have to split this up into smaller sections.  Stay tuned for articles on Python, Redhat, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes & whatever else I can think of between now and then.
